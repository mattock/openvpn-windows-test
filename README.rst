openvpn-windows-test
====================

Powershell scripts for testing OpenVPN on Windows. The Test-Openvpn.ps1 script
can test OpenVPN in cmd.exe, OpenVPN-GUI and  openvpnserv2. Success and failure
are based on simple ping tests to one or more hosts. A typical use-case for
these scripts is smoke-testing an installer prior to a major release.

Usage
=====

The main script tests only one VPN connection:
::
  Usage: Test-Openvpn.ps1 -Config <openvpn-config-file> -Ping <hosts> [-Openvpn <openvpn-exe>] [-Gui <openvpn-gui-exe>] [-TestCmdexe] [-TestService] [-TestGui] [-Help]
  
  Parameters:
     -Openvpn     Path to openvpn.exe (defaults to C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\bin\openvpn.exe)
     -Gui         Path to openvpn-gui.exe (defaults to C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\bin\openvpn-gui.exe)
     -Config      Path to the OpenVPN configuration file
     -Ping        Target host(s) inside VPN to ping (should succeed). Separate multiple entries
                  with commas.
     -TestCmdexe  Test connection from the command-line
     -TestGui     Test OpenVPN-GUI
     -TestService Test openvpnserv2.exe
     -Help        Display this help
  
  Example: .\Test-Openvpn -Config "C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\company.ovpn" -Ping 192.168.40.7 -TestCmdexe -TestService -TestGui

 To verify that the connections do not succeed because of a bug or by accident,
-Ping a fake IP that can only fail.

Note that Windows may prompt for user feedback at certain points, e.g. to allow
connections through the firewall. The answers can typically be cached, so that
the script can run without user interaction.

To test several connections in a row copy `run-sample.ps1 <run-sample.ps1>`_ to
run.ps1 and adapt it to your needs. This way you can verify that your particular
version of OpenVPN works with all of your VPN connections.

Note that right now OpenVPN might mess up IPv6 routes if OpenVPN instances are
killed forcibly, as this script does in most cases. This can cause IPv6 ping
tests to fail after an initial connection.

If you want the script to signal openvpn.exe before killing after the test, add

    management 127.0.0.1 58581

to your (test) OpenVPN configuration file. This approach will only work when
the script is launched with -TestCmdexe.

Scope of the tests
==================

OpenVPN inside cmd.exe
----------------------

Connect -> ping test -> disconnect

OpenVPN GUI
-----------

Connect -> ping test -> disconnect

Openvpnserv2
------------

Connect -> ping test -> kill openvpn -> openvpnserv2 restart openvpn -> ping test -> disconnect

Warnings
========

The script brutally kills every openvpn.exe and openvpn-gui.exe process it
finds at startup, as well as stops OpenVPNService. Similarly, when it is done
with each test, it in general kills the processes without signaling them.

The openvpnserv2-based tests move irrelevant .ovpn files out of the way to the
current working directory before launching the service. After the test the
files are put back where they belong. If the script is stopped in the middle,
some .ovpn files may have to be moved back manually.

While this script seems to work fine, it can potentially cause issues. At
minimum make sure that your VPN configurations are backed up.
